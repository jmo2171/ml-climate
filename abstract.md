Predicting wildfire growth is essential for disaster preparedness. Currently, most literature on wildfire risk assessment centers around computationally intense physics-based simulations or correlative models to predict regions with high risk of wildfire growth. After creating a dataset by combining US Wildfire data with meteorological data, we developed a set of causal models to predict wildfire size in the United States. First we searched for graphical causal models (GCMs) represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to describe our causal models. Next we modeled our variables using linear regression, polynomial regression, XGBoost and MORD (Multi-class Classifier for Ordinal Regression) and a combination of these techniques. We evaluated the best structural causal model (SCM) with a random test-train split and then with a time-dependent test-train split to understand its generalization potential. We compared our SCM's performance on both types of test-train splits to the performance of an XGBoost model (our best performing traditional ML model) on the same task.
