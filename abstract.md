Predicting wildfire spread is essential for diaster preparedness. Currently, most literature on wildfire risk assessment centers around computationally intense physics-based simulations or correlative models to predict regions with high risk of wildfire spread. We develop a set of causal models to predict wildfire spread in the United States. First we search for graphical causal models (GCMs) represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to describe our causal models. Next we model our variables using linear regression, polynomial regression, XGBoost and MORD (Multi-class Classifier for Ordinal Regression) and a combination of these techniques. We evaluate the best structural causal model (SCM) with a random test-train split and then with a time-dependent test-train split to understand its generalization potential. We compare our SCM's performance on both types of test-train splits to the performance of an OrdinalLGBM model (the best performing traditional ML model) on the same task.
